This file was added by the scaffold script.

Created folders and starter files:

- components/HelloWorld.vue  -> simple example component
- layouts/default.vue        -> basic layout that renders <NuxtPage />
- composables/useAuth.ts     -> small auth composable (useState wrapper)
- types/index.d.ts           -> global types placeholder
- assets/                    -> static assets folder

How to use:
- Put shared components in `components/`.
- Customize `layouts/default.vue` as the app shell.
- Add composables in `composables/` and types in `types/`.
